# AirHockey Vulkan

## Overview

AirHockey Vulkan is a fully playable air hockey game for two players, built from the ground up using the Vulkan graphics API. This project demonstrates low-level graphics programming, game physics, and game logic implementation without relying on a game engine.

## Features

- Two-player air hockey gameplay
- Custom physics engine for realistic puck and paddle movements
- Game logic implemented directly in Vulkan
- Low-level graphics rendering using Vulkan API
- Smooth and efficient performance

## Technical Details

- **Graphics API**: Vulkan
- **Language**: C++ (assuming, please correct if different)
- **Physics**: Custom-built physics system for air hockey dynamics
- **Game Logic**: Implemented without a game engine, directly integrated with Vulkan

## Development

This project was developed as part of a Computer Graphics course, showcasing the ability to:
- Implement a game from scratch using a low-level graphics API
- Create a custom physics system for game object interactions
- Integrate game logic directly with graphics rendering
- Optimize performance using Vulkan's capabilities
